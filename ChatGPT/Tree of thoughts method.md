## 1. Brainstorming - 
- The purpose of this phase is to generate a diverse range of solution to a problem. This involves opening up the problem space, challenging assumptions, and thinking creatively. The AI model uses its vast knowledge base to generate potential solutions, leveraging trends, data and knowledge it has been trained on. 
- **Prompt** : "I have a problem related to (Describe your problem). Could you brainstorm three distinct solutions? Please consider a variety of factors such as (Your factors)"

- Example : I have a problem, How am I supposed to tell my boss that i want a raise. Some info about me........ Could you brainstorm 3 distinct solutions? Please consider a variety of factors such as (timing, background, professionalism and value propostition)

## 2. Evaluation Phase - 
- **prompt** : "for each of the proposed solutions, evaluate their potential. Consider their pros and cons, initial effort needed, implementation difficulty, potential challenges, and the expected outcome. Assign a probability of success and a confidence level to each option based on these factors." 

## 3. Expansion Phase - 
- This stage involves delving deeper into each idea, refining it, and imagining its implementation in real-world context. It's about examining different scenarios, predicitng and addressing potential challenges, and visualizing the pathway from concept to realization. This helps in assessing the robustness of each solution and its adaptability to possible changes and unforeseen events.
- **prompt**: "for each solution, deepen the thought process. Generate potential scenarios, Strategies for implementation, any necessary partnerships or resources, and how potential obstacles might be overcome. Also, consider any potential unexpected outcomes and how they might be handled."

## 4. Decision Phase - 
- In the final phase, based on the evaluations and scenarios generated, the AI ranks the solutions in order of promise. it will justify its choices, offering reasons for each ranking and providing final thoughts on each solution. This process assists in choosing the most promising solution to proceed with, back by logical reasoning and thorough analysis. 
- **prompt:** "Based on the evaluations and scenarios, rank the solutions in order of promise. Provide a justification for each ranking and offer any final thoughts or considerations for each solution."
