## In this course you will learn:
- how to identify a problem
- what a process is and how to improve it
- How to start solving problems


## Module 1: Introduction
### What is a problem?
- Anything that can go wrong
- outcomes that are different from what is intended
- Observable or objectively measured

### Problems are not:
- Blaming people
- Finding fault
- Determining Solutions and causes

### Examples of common problems:
- Being put on hold too long on the phone while trying to make  an appointment
- Receiving incorrect change after you've paid for something
- Receiving the wrong medication from your pharmacy 
- Running out of gas when the car's fuel gauge shows half-full

### Why is identifying Problems Important?
- Gives you the chance to make things better
- Provides focus as you proceed
- Closes the gap between the actual results and what is expected
- Leads to increased customer satisfaction and profitability
- help you work better with your teams and creates a great place to work

- Can be documented and standardized
- can be studied, improved and taught to others
- link to solving problems
- "You can't improve what you don't understand! "


### Types of Problems:
- Cycle type : when something takes too long to happen
- defects: when the outcome isn't right

### what is a Process?
#### processes are:
- Series of actions that produce an intended result
- teachable
- capable of being repeated

#### processes are not:
- Results
- people or job descriptions

###  Undesired result of a process = Problem 


### What are some types of processes:
- physical processes
- transactional processes


#### Examples of everyday procceses:
- Brushing your teeth
- getting an oil change
- making a meal
- paying bills
- Traveling to work

### What is a physical process?
- physical processes can be seen
- Examples of everyday physical processes include:
	- cleaning a room
	- getting your oil changed
	- mowing your lawn
	- soldering a circuit board


### What is a transactional Process?
- transactional processes can be invisible
- Examples of everyday processes include:
	- ordering a online product
	- filing your income tax return
	- processing a loan application
	- Onboarding a new employee


what is Lean Six sigma:
- lean focuses on removing wasteful activities in processes
- six sigma focuses on reducing process defects

### What is DMAIC:
- a process improvement methodology 
- Define:
	- Clarify the problem and process
- measure
	- Quantify the problem and map the process
- Analyze
	- Determine the root causes
- Improve
	- Confirm the solutions work
- Control
	- Ensure the gains are sustained


### Belt levels:
- Yellow: Introduction to lean six sigma. Awareness training for all employees
	- How to select a good project:
		- what are the main :"deliverables" you provide
		- each deliverable is produced by some sequence of events
			- if the process has a name, identify it
			- if not, make up a name, based on what the process does
		- Choose a process that represents a substantial portion of your work
			- look for ways to make it better 
			- if you know of an obvious problem in the process, you can try to fix it
- Green: Intermediate training for lean six sigma project managers.
- Black: Advanced training for continuous improvement leaders.


## Module 2: Define Phase
the first letter in DMAIC:
	Clarify the problem and process

### what is project charter:
- Explains what your project will attempt to accomplish
- Outlines the project in clear, concise wording


## Module 3: Measure phase
- the 2nd letter in the DMAIC process improvement acronym
	Quantify the problem and map the process.

### what is a process map (Flowcharts):
- shows the process as a whole
- the sequence of steps
- the relationship of steps
- the starting and ending steps of the process
- A visual representation of the process

![[Pasted image 20240102121121.png]]
- some processes have a fork in path

### to make a processmap (flowchart):
- identify the starting and end points
- gather input from people who work within the process

### What is a swimlane Map:
- A type of process map in which the different participants are given separate lanes
- when the process flow crosses another lane, it shows the work being continued in a different lane
![[Pasted image 20240102121919.png]]

### How to "see" your process
- start at the beginning of the process
- walking through the sequence of steps to completion
- Observe what happens at each step
#### why is "Seeing" my process important
- The perspective of the process is important, seeing it in your view can solve the problem.
- Allows you to gather clues to solve your problem]
- change the process to change the results

### What is a process walk?
- a tour of the area where work takes place
	- Find what is the scope, or steps in the process, should the team observe?
- includes a series of observations and sometimes interviews
- find opportunities and understand the work

### Loopbacks
- something hasn't gone correctly in the process
- work needs to be redone and started over
- Error correction: A mistake was made in the process and it needs to be fixed
- Ready yet: A review is done and the work is either incomplete or needs to be redone


### What are the 8 Wastes?
- Waste that ineffectively consume resources, space and time.
- Acronym: DOWNTIME
	- Defects
		- Too much or too little of something 
		- The wrong thing
		- the right thing, something else is wrong
	- Overproductions
		- Producing something more or sooner than needed
		- Creates additional waste of inventory
			- Ex. Making many gallons of coffee
			- Guessing how much someone might want
	- Waiting
		- When work is unable to proceed because something is unavailable
		- Can result in wasted labor, delayed work and increased cycle time
			- Ex. waiting for an approval or waiting for a computer response or missing info
	- Non-Utilized Talent
		- Not properly utilizing people's experience, skills or creativity
		- Ex. Using skilled labor for non-skilled tasks, Workers assigned to jobs that don't fit their skills and talents
	- Transportation
		- Excessive movement of things, such as materials, products or tools
		- Physical process examples:
			- Transport of parts and materials to production lines
			- Too many or multiple handoffs on a Process
	- Inventory
		- More than the amount of supplies needed for the current work
			- Storing 3 month's worth of coffee beans on hand
			- Storing Raw materials and supplies for months, when days of inventory would be enough
	- Motion
		- Excess movement of people
			- Reaching excessive distances for cups
			- walking to get more supplies
	- Extra Processing
		- Any additional work that is done beyond what is truly needed
			- Excessive approvals
			- Double-checking calculations

### What are some other process issues?
- Handoffs
- Preparations and setup
- Disorganization
- Approvals 
- Reports

#### How to perform a process walk:
1. Pick a process 
	- Work within your department
2. Create your process map
	- Write down what happens first, write down the steps to get to the end (As-is map)
3. Walk your process
	- Follow your process maps
	- observe what happens
	- Ask questions and find wastes and opportunities
1. Summarize your observations
	- Update the process map
	- Evaluate and prioritize the waste
	- Note their impact

#### Prioritize waste and Opportunities
- Sort by low, medium, or high impact
	- Medium : Causes delays and may be noticed by the customer
	- low: Causes minor inconveniences not noticed by the customer
	- high: causes a bad product or experience noticed by the customer



## Analyze Phase: Module 4
- Determine the root causes

### Why is analyzing my process important?
- helps you find the root causes of problems
- helps you make the best decision to solve the problem
- reveals opportunities for improvement 

### How Do I seek and determine Root Causes?
- Select the wastes that had a high impact on your process
- Determine the root cause by asking "Why?"

### The 5 whys?
- Technique used to determine the root cause of a problem
- focus on the causes that occur in your process
- avoid jumping to conclusions
- the "5" in 5 whys is just a rule of thumb

### How Do i properly Pose a 5 why Answer?
- Focus on the process, not the people
- Avoid solution in disguise
	- "Lack of budget"
	- lack of training
	- "Lack of ____"
- Ask yourself what problem does a specific solution solve
- keep digging deeper
- Stay within the boundaries of the organization
- keep asking why until you reach a level of detail that can be fixed

### How DO i confirm root cause with a logic check
- Read the check sequence from top to bottom
- see if your logic makes sense
- re-check your whys if it doesn't make sense



## Improve Phase : Module 5
### Confirm the solution works

### Why is improving your process important
- to eliminate or minimize the issues causing your problem
- solutions will be changes in the process and may include:
	- adding, deleting or re-sequences steps
	- changing how a step is done
	- streamlining the entire process
- #### Types of improvements
	- 5 steps
	- quick win solutions

### What is 5 steps
- Sort
	- Anything that is moveable should be considered be moving out or into the workspaces
	- Less used items can be stored further away
	- frequently used items should be kept nearby
	- Benefits
		- Eliminates walls that hinder communication
		- improved process flow
		- less time searching for items
		- lowered maintenance costs
		- workspace becomes less crowded and easier to work in 
- set in order
	- Arrange items that are needed in the area
	- Create order so anyone can find and return things
	- Benefits
		- adequate space is allocated
		- items have "Their place"
		- time spent looking for things is reduced
		- wrong items aren't retrieved in error
- shine 
	- Remove the dirt, grime and dust from the work area
	- Benefits:
		- Defects are easier to see
		- improved workplace safety
		- Machines work more efficiently
		- Promotes improved morale
- standardize 
	- Develop a consistent way of implementing the tasks
	- Schedules are formalized and documented
	- Benefits:
		- Easier to train new employees 
		- less room for errors and scrap
		- work areas stay organized
		- work area is safer
- sustain:
	- Periodic audits are planned and executed
	- audit results are posted
	- staff is held accountable
	- Benefits:
		- Discipline that ensures continued success
		- 5s mentality is ingrained
		- cleaner, safer, working environment
		- efficient processes
		- higher employee morale
### Why is 5 steps important
- creates order in a disorganized area 
- creates an organized, clean and high-performance workplace
- can be used as a quick win and process control
- Most processes can benefit from 5s!

### How to use the 5s?
- Areas with obvious disorganization or clutter
- spaces can be physical or virtual
- implement as early as you can


### What are quick win solutions?
- Obvious solutions that can be implemented quickly
- quick wins are:
	- Cheap 
	- easy
	- fast
	- low risk
	- within your control

- examples within a process:
	- adding steps
	- removing steps
	- revising steps


### What is a solution implementation plan?
- Collaborate with those who work in the process
- identify the tasks needed
- note who will perform the actions
- set a completion date
- monitor progress
- document the results

What is a To-Be map?
- Review the As-is map and make changes
- add notes to describe what is different
	- before and after


## Control Phase : Module 6
### Ensure the gains are sustained

### Why is controlling your process important?
- as people change, and time goes on, we might lose some improvements
- reduces wasted time
- speeds up cross-training and onboarding
- helps identify waste
- establishes a starting point for improvement

### How Do I control my process?
- Identify how the work should be done, such as through a To-Be process Map
- Create standard Operating procedures (SoPs)
- Consider what could come undone
- identify how to see when the process goes off course
- if you implemented 5s, the sustain audits are your control
- visual management is an effective way to control your process

### What are standard Operating procedures?
- detailed documentation of how to do the work
- ensures process is performed consistently
- explains who does what tasks, when and in what way


### What is Visual Management?
- a method for visually displaying all information to maximize efficiency
- involves all employees to help organize and create systems
- some ways to implement:
	- color-coding
	- boundary markers
	- large readable signs and symbols
	- safety markings
- Examples:
	- Crosswalk lights and street lights
	- laptop battery icon with color
	- workplaces:
		- display board and storyboards
		- maintenance schedules
		- standardized work documentation 
		- status lights and signals on equipment

### What is the project Handoff?
- Project Handoff:
	- key actions to close the project
	- summarizes project results and controls 
	- documents approval to close the project
	- allows the project leader to move on to other work
	- equips the process owner to hold the gains

### What is the project Summary?
- provides an overview of your project
- excellent tool to quickly communicate success
- examples seen on a project summary:
	- Problems found:
	- action taken:
	- as-is and To-be process maps/flowcharts
