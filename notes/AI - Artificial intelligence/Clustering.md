- K-means algo
	- may not give you the best clusters
	- K-means might terminate, if there is no change in the cluster assignments, it will terminate
	- Issues
		- Clustering is "NP-Hard" - unlikely to have an efficient algo 
			- Solution: try a couple more times and pick the best result
		- Linear Dimension Reduction:
			- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
		- tsne: T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
	- When does it work well
		- when the clusters are clearly separated
		- for higher dimension data, it is harder to visualize like 2d data
	- When does it NOT work well

			- Although we can see the 4 clusters as humans, it is not as easy for machines.
	- Gaussian Mixture model
