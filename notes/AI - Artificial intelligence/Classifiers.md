## Logistic Regression
- One of the most used classifiers
- Very simple but generalizes to neural networks
- Basic version is a linear binary classifier
- related to linear regression
- But it is a algorithm for classification and not regression



## Linear Regression
- Model Parameters
- On input x = [x1, ....., xn], the model outputs


Decision Boundary
