<h1>Script</h1>
- when you write script and run script, you can see which line of code is cause a problem.


<h1>Compiler</h1>
- does not need a complier
- when you compile the code it creates a variable and function table, to Optimize performance
- Faster than script. 


although compiler is FASTER than script languages, technological advances have made the script language speed BARELY noticeable. 

<h1>Portability</h1>
- java:
	- JVM
- C
	- You have to recompile on another machine
	- Set of instructions



RISS: Reduced instruction set compiler
CISS: 
	- faster than RISS
	- complex
