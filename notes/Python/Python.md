<h1>Python</h1>

is a coding language with modules like [[Pandas]] and [[Numpy]]

<h2>Def __init__()</h2>
- the constructor of python
- this is automatically invoked when we create a new class instance/object

# Data Structures found in python: 

## Tuples:
- Are immutable, which means nothing can add or change them or remove them
```python
tupleVar = (1,2,3,4) 
```



## Map (In python is called a dictionary):
You can efficiently
- Look up a data by key
- Return the value of an existing key in the map
- Update the value of an existing key in the map
- add a new key-value pair to the map
- remove an existing entry from the map

### Dictionary:
They can be set up like so:
```python
dictionary = dict()
d = dict()
d['a'] = 1
d['b'] = 2
d['c'] = 3

#{'a' : 1, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 3}
```
