## In this course you will learn:
- how to identify a problem
- what a process is and how to improve it
- How to start solving problems


## Module 1: Introduction
### What is a problem?
- Anything that can go wrong
- outcomes that are different from what is intended
- Observable or objectively measured

### Problems are not:
- Blaming people
- Finding fault
- Determining Solutions and causes

### Examples of common problems:
- Being put on hold too long on the phone while trying to make  an appointment
- Receiving incorrect change after you've paid for something
- Receiving the wrong medication from your pharmacy 
- Running out of gas when the car's fuel gauge shows half-full

### Why is identifying Problems Important?
- Gives you the chance to make things better
- Provides focus as you proceed
- Closes the gap between the actual results and what is expected
- Leads to increased customer satisfaction and profitability
- help you work better with your teams and creates a great place to work

- Can be documented and standardized
- can be studied, improved and taught to others
- link to solving problems
- "You can't improve what you don't understand! "


### Types of Problems:
- Cycle type : when something takes too long to happen
- defects: when the outcome isn't right

### what is a Process?
#### processes are:
- Series of actions that produce an intended result
- teachable
- capable of being repeated

#### processes are not:
- Results
- people or job descriptions

###  Undesired result of a process = Problem 


### What are some types of processes:
- physical processes
- transactional processes


#### Examples of everyday procceses:
- Brushing your teeth
- getting an oil change
- making a meal
- paying bills
- Traveling to work

### What is a physical process?
- physical processes can be seen
- Examples of everyday physical processes include:
	- cleaning a room
	- getting your oil changed
	- mowing your lawn
	- soldering a circuit board


### What is a transactional Process?
- transactional processes can be invisible
- Examples of everyday processes include:
	- ordering a online product
	- filing your income tax return
	- processing a loan application
	- Onboarding a new employee


what is Lean Six sigma:
- lean focuses on removing wasteful activities in processes
- six sigma focuses on reducing process defects

### What is DMAIC:
- a process improvement methodology 
- Define:
	- Clarify the problem and process
- measure
	- Quantify the problem and map the process
- Analyze
	- Determine the root causes
- Improve
	- Confirm the solutions work
- Control
	- Ensure the gains are sustained


### Belt levels:
- Yellow: Introduction to lean six sigma. Awareness training for all employees
	- How to select a good project:
		- what are the main :"deliverables" you provide
		- each deliverable is produced by some sequence of events
			- if the process has a name, identify it
			- if not, make up a name, based on what the process does
		- Choose a process that represents a substantial portion of your work
			- look for ways to make it better 
			- if you know of an obvious problem in the process, you can try to fix it
- Green: Intermediate training for lean six sigma project managers.
- Black: Advanced training for continuous improvement leaders.


## Module 2: Define Phase
the first letter in DMAIC:
Define:
	Clarify the problem and process
