- BFS
	- Breath first search
- DFS
	- Depth first search
- Always goes down


<h2>Graph / Cycle</h2>
- can move anywhere other than down
- Shortest path algo


<h2>Binary Search trees (BST)</h2> 
- O(log n) search in a sorted tree(BST)
- The sort/search algorithm can be compared to cutting by halves.
